### Description

This code allows you to control all new windows within your application.

EVEN those pesky little Ctrl + N windows.

This code isn't the best code, and i plan on adding alot more functionality to it. [IE: Favorites, ETC] But at least it shows you how to do basic stuff.

This app also has an Auto-Complete URL Bar...

And displays how to tell your users that it is a secure site.

<BR>

Update (15/06/2003):

Also: I have added a "Text Size" Menu to the webbrowser, for zooming the text, like within internet explorer, and some other basic functions.
 
### More Info
 
You need to enable KeyPreview for your browser form,

Then enter the code into the KeyDown of the form, which is in my form's key-down...
